1,1,The importance of communication in personal relationships,"Communication is a fundamental aspect of personal relationships, whether they are romantic, familial, or platonic. Effective communication is crucial in establishing and maintaining healthy relationships. Open and honest communication can strengthen the bond between individuals and build trust.

4,1,The Sky,The sky was a deep shade of blue as the sun set on the horizon. A gentle breeze carried the sound of birds chirping and leaves rustling through the air.

7,3,Should i keep interviewing for practice or save my energy?,"I have had been interviewing with lots of companies lately. I have like 7 interviews from the past 3 days. Just for context, I am relatively young; 18 years old and a graduating senior high student.

I just realize that it is so mentally tolling to interview continously, with no ROI at all. It is understandable though, I am still studying and not even a high school graduate. I still have two virtual interviews in line, however, I am conflicted to attend. Due to obvious reason.

My question is, do you think it is worth it to keep interviewing or should I just save my energy? Should I just focus on self studying (the route I took) and pour my energy in interviews after graduating in high school? In regards to if I would go to college, as much as I like, it is simply not sustainable for me even if I have to attend in a state university, due to life constraints.",,John Doe,John Doe,2023-03-02 13:47:12.916287,2023-03-02 13:47:12.916287
8,3,Vue vs Angular: Choose the Best Framework in 2023,"Vue and Angular are both popular front-end JavaScript frameworks used to build dynamic web applications. Both have their own unique features and advantages.

Vue is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It has a very small footprint, making it ideal for building smaller projects or prototypes. It also offers excellent documentation, making it easy for developers to learn and use. Vue is often seen as a more lightweight and flexible framework than Angular, which may make it a better choice for smaller projects or teams with limited resources. On the other hand, Angular is a comprehensive framework with a lot of built-in features, making it ideal for complex, enterprise-level applications.",,John Doe,John Doe,2023-03-15 11:47:12.916287,2023-03-15 11:47:12.916287
9,3,How lucrative is Laravel freelancing?,"I'm basically just looking for some ways to help pay the bills, and I was wondering if any of you fine folks have tried picking up Laravel-related freelance jobs, on something like Upwork.

10,3,Educate me about CPU thermals. Genuine question,"I understand that a CPU has a base clock and a boost clock. The CPU understands when it needs to boost to gain some extra juice and perform better in certain applications and programs. It doesn't boost if it knows there isn't adequate cooling, hence your performance suffers by thermal throttling, so it requires a stronger cooler (be it a tower air cooler, custom loop water cooling, or an AIO).

I'm using a Ryzen 5 5600. My question is, since my CPU reaches its boost clock of 4450 mhz even on intense gaming sessions and the temps maxed out that I have recorded and monitored via NZXT CAM is 69 degrees (nice), would there be any difference in terms of performance if I upgraded to a tower air cooler, seeing as to how I've reached the boost clock of my CPU under thermal-throttling territory.",,John Doe,John Doe,2023-03-30 16:47:12.916287,2023-03-30 16:47:12.916287

15,5,what is the best way to handle heavy reads on one Table,"i have a multi vendor e-commerce website, and each product has its views stored. Each record represents 1 unique visit, and so on

expected to have at least 1000 views per product and will have 100+ product

every vendor will have access to analytics, like product views in the last 30 days , week , today , etc

caching these results, in my opinion, will consume a lot of disk space,

so i thought whenever i recorded a new visit in the views table, i increment a column ""total views"" in the product table

will count the total but not in month or week or day and all other possibilities

what is the best approach i can do in this situation ?",,Kelsey Lawson,Kelsey Lawson,2022-12-13 16:37:55.89879,2022-12-13 16:37:55.89879
16,5,Package to speed up api development,"Does anyone know of a package that has a similar developer experience to Nova and Filament where you define your models/resources and the routes, validation and crud operations get created?

UPDATE - Thanks for initial suggestions but I am not looking for an admin panel or code generation. I have a current app with 100+ models and a lot of these are relatively simple objects but i have to create 3-4 files per each. I really like how Nova directs all traffic to /nova/resources/{resource}/{resourceId?} etc.. and then resolves the resource back to a class so was just wondering if there is a similar package/library that exists.

ANOTHER UPDATE - I've mocked up a simple example of how this might work as per below. If there aren't any packages like this I might take this further.",,Kelsey Lawson,Kelsey Lawson,2023-04-08 09:47:12.916287,2023-04-08 09:47:12.916287

18,5,Introduction to Laravel PHP Framework,"Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web application framework designed to make building web applications easier and more efficient. It was created by Taylor Otwell in 2011 and has since become one of the most popular PHP frameworks available. Laravel follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and provides a wide range of features and tools to help developers build scalable and maintainable web applications. Some of the key features of Laravel include its elegant syntax, powerful routing system, built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms, and a vast library of pre-built components and packages. With its intuitive design and comprehensive documentation, Laravel has become a top choice for developers looking to streamline their development process and build high-quality web applications.",,Kelsey Lawson,Kelsey Lawson,2023-04-16 16:14:13.264682,2023-04-16 16:14:13.264682
